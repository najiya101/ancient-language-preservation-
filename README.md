# Ancient Text Preservation with IndicBERT

This project aims to restore and preserve ancient Sanskrit texts by predicting missing words using a fine-tuned IndicBERT model. Users can upload images of ancient Sanskrit texts, extract text from them, and fill in missing words using BERT-based masked language modeling.

### Features
- __Upload Images__ ‚Äì Extract text from scanned Sanskrit documents using Google Vision OCR
- __Masked Word Prediction__ ‚Äì Replace missing words with [MASK] and predict possible words using Fine-tuned IndicBERT
- __Direct Text Input__ ‚Äì Users can also manually enter Sanskrit text instead of uploading an image
- __Real-time Predictions__ ‚Äì Get the top predicted words for each masked token

### How It Works

1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload an image of an ancient Sanskrit text
2Ô∏è‚É£ The site extracts text from the image
3Ô∏è‚É£ Add [MASK] in places where words are missing
4Ô∏è‚É£ The model predicts the top possible words
5Ô∏è‚É£ View the results and use them for text restoration

### Technologies Used
- __Flask__ ‚Äì Web framework
- __Google Vision API__ ‚Äì OCR for Sanskrit text extraction
- __Fine-tuned IndicBERT__ ‚Äì Masked word prediction
- __Deep Translator__ ‚Äì Sanskrit to English translation
